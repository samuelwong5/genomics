Index Builder v1.0 James Arram 2016
-----------------------------------

To build:
$ sh install.sh
$ make

to run:
$ ./index_build <fasta file>

Notes:
1) This program uses libdivsufsort to generate the suffix array 
2) The FM-index is contructed with step size = 3
3) The input fasta file should have alphabet {A, C, G, T, N}
4) Any 'N' sequences longer than 10 are removed. The remaining 'N'
characters are replaced by 'G'
5) The suffix array is not sampled to improve pattern matching
performance
